## Tips & Tricks

### Getting the Perfect Crop
- **Center your face:** Position your face in the center of the yellow square
- **Leave some space:** Don't zoom in too much - leave a little room around your face
- **Try rotating:** If your head is tilted, use the rotate buttons to straighten it
- **Use preview:** The preview panel on the right shows exactly what others will see

### Image Requirements
- **Formats:** JPG, PNG, or GIF
- **Size:** Under 2MB
- **Recommended:** At least 400x400 pixels for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio:** Any - we'll crop to a perfect square

### Troubleshooting

**"File size must be less than 2MB"**
- Your image is too large
- Try compressing it with an image editor
- Or try a different image

**"Error uploading picture. Please try again."**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the image format is supported (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

**Preview doesn't look right?**
- Click "Reset" and try again
- Make sure you're not zoomed in too much
- Check that rotation is correct

**Image looks blurry after upload?**
- Try uploading a higher resolution image
- Or zoom in less before cropping

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Your image is loaded** into an editor canvas (stays in your browser)
2. **You position it** - only you can see the adjustments
3. **You click Apply** - the exact 400x400px square you see is generated
4. **It's uploaded** - sent as a JPEG to the server
5. **It's stored** - saved to your profile picture file
6. **It's displayed** - shown on your profile and around the app

The original image is **never** stored - only the cropped 400x400px version you created.
